# Project details

This project consists of a calculator which has few of the basic arithmetic operations and numeric conversions. It is coded using MIPS assembly language and is executable using SPIM (MIPS simulator).

The program consists of few of the basic arithmetic operations like 'Addition', 'Subtraction', 'Multiplication', and 'Division'.

It also consists of a list of conversion options to convert input values between hexadecimal, decimal, and binary.

The calculator is easy to use since the User Interface is very simple to understand and provides all details required for the user to understand without any hassles.

Prompts are provided at every step for inputs required from the user, whether it be an option from the menu list or an input for conversion or performing some arithmetic operation.

The flowchart for the code is available [here](project/flow%20chart.pdf)
