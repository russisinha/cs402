The is a simple C program to simulate a calculator.
The operations of the calculator are:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- 1/X
- X^2                   e.g) 4^2 = 16
- Power of y (X^y)   e.g) 4^3 or Power(4, 3) = 64
- N!                     e.g) 4! or fact(4) = 24

The calculation accepts more than two operands such as:

2 + 4 x 3 = 14  /* in this case user input must do 4 x 3 first and add 2 to produce the correct result) */
